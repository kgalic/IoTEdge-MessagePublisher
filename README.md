# IoTEdge-MessagePublisher
A tool for debugging individual modules triggered by the IoT Edge Routes. In the case where a module that has to be debugged is triggered by the nested routes, it makes debugging harder to trigger the whole route chain. With this tool, the developer can pipe the message in the dedicated route and that way have isolated debugging of the dedicated IoT Edge module.
